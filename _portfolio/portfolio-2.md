## Introduction
Cultural heritage sites often degrade over time due to environmental factors, losing some of their original splendor. To revive a sense of these sites' historic grandeur and encourage speculation about their future, we conducted a workshop. Participants used Stable Diffusion to recreate images of these sites in various scenarios through prompting. 

Participants demonstrated distinct interaction patterns. Our findings indicate that the images generated evoke past memories in participants, offer new insights and emotions, and enhance their emotional connection with these cultural heritages. We also found that participantsâ€™ perceptions and interpretations of cultural heritages are deeply personal and diverse, potentially providing intriguing inspirations for those with different views and memories of the same heritages.This project showcases the potential of generative AI in forstering people's expression and imagination of cultural heritages.
