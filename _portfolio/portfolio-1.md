## Introduction
Recent research suggests the potential of utilizing interactive technology to support self-transcendent positive emotional experiences, thereby promoting physical and psychological well-being. Among positive emotions, awe is complex, emerging when people experience something greater than themselves. This emotion can lead to prosocial behaviors, pro-environmental actions, and reduced anxiety.

Based on theories related to the sublime and embodiment, we designed a head-mounted VR experience, aimed at effectively inducing awe experiences. Our VR design allowed participants to experience the day-night cycle with the vast moon and rising tide by viewing and controlling the virtual body and feeling the sensation of raindrops and wave splashes.
