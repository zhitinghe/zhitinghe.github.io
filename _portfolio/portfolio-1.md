## Introduction
Recent research suggests the potential of utilizing interactive technology to support self-transcendent positive emotional experiences, thereby promoting physical and psychological well-being. Among positive emotions, awe is complex, emerging when people experience something greater than themselves. This emotion can lead to prosocial behaviors, pro-environmental actions, and reduced anxiety.

Based on theories related to the sublime and embodiment, we designed a head-mounted VR experience, aimed at effectively inducing awe experiences. Our VR design allowed participants to experience the day-night cycle with the vast moon and rising tide by viewing and controlling the virtual body and feeling the sensation of raindrops and wave splashes.

## My Role
- Investigated sublime theories and proposed design elements independently
- Led a team in developing awe-inspiring VR prototypes, designing a scheme for simulating the tactile sensation of raindrops
- Devised the experimental process, which included a one-week interval and exposure to three VR scenarios for each participant. Searched for scales related to awe and embodiment and formulated a semi-structured interview outline
- Completed 28 experiments within two weeks, conducting all semi-structured interviews
- Led the team in analyzing scale and interview data, distilling key themes
- Wrote the entire paper under the guidance of the professor
- Writed paper.
