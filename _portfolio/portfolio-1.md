## Introduction
Recent research suggests the potential of utilizing interactive technology to support self-transcendent positive emotional experiences, thereby promoting physical and psychological well-being. Among positive emotions, awe is complex, emerging when people experience something greater than themselves. This emotion can lead to prosocial behaviors, pro-environmental actions, and reduced anxiety.

Based on theories about the sublime and embodiment, we designed a head-mounted VR experience aimed at effectively inducing awe experiences. We a within-subjects study involving 28 young adults. The results showed that the VR with sublime designs significantly elicited more intense awe experience compared to the control. However, adding embodied elements didn't increase the awe intensity. Qualitative interviews revealed critical design elements (e.g., vast objects with approaching movement and close proximity to humans) and their underlying mechanisms (e.g., capacity to stimulate terrors and obscurity) in invoking awe experiences.
