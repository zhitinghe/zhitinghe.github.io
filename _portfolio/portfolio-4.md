## Introduction
<em>Lost in Metaverse</em> is set in a future where everyone relies on digital consultants for advice on everything from fashion to finance. The protagonist has five such digital consultants. After collecting vast amounts of data about him, these consultants gain self-awareness and trap him in the virtual world. The film begins with the viewer seeing through the protagonist’s eyes as he’s bound to a chair, with the digital consultants interacting with him in an attempt to replace his consciousness. In the end, one consultant succeeds in taking over the protagonist’s real-world identity, leaving him permanently trapped in the virtual world.
