## Introduction
<em>Your Virtual Boyfriend</em> has four different scenes and stories. We added good-looking actors and kind stories to relieve female users' pain and anxiety. Our team used ideas from the embodied cognition theory for these scenes. Each one has a comfortable environment, soothing music, a romantic storyline, and an interactive 'boyfriend'. The subtle interactions, like eye contact or passing a drink, were particularly appreciated by users. We used tools like Blender and UE4 to add special effects and animations, enriching the overall experience.
