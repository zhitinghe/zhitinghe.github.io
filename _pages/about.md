# Biography

Hello! I'm Zhiting He, but feel free to call me Justine. I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Digital Media Art at the Communication University of China. I've always been fascinated by the influence of technology on our lives, especially within the realms of Virtual Reality (VR) and digital mental health. I've been fortunate to participate in several research projects, both at my university and at other institutions like the City University of Hong Kong. Much of my research focuses on VR design to support mental health and self-development, but I also delve into topics related to AIGC and cultural heritage.
