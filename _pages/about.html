    <p>
     Hi! I'm a recent master's graduate in Digital Media Art from the Communication University of China, with a deep passion for leveraging emerging technologies to empower individuals and enhance well-being. My recent research has centered on creating awe-inspiring virtual environments aimed at improving mental health. Additionally, I’ve explored how AI can be used to enable people to engage with and contribute to local cultural narratives.

      <p><em>Abstract:</em> Research suggests the potential of employing VR to elicit awe experiences, thereby promoting well-being. Building upon theories related to the sublime and embodiment, we designed three VR scenes to evaluate the effectiveness of sublime and embodied design elements in invoking awe experiences. We conducted a within-subject study involving 28 young adults who experienced the three VR designs. Results demonstrated that the VR design with sublime elements significantly elicited more intense awe experiences compared to the one without, while adding embodied elements did not enhance the intensity of awe. Qualitative interviews revealed critical design elements (e.g., the obscure event should be reasonable) and their underlying mechanisms (e.g., leading to feelings of enlightenment) in invoking awe experiences. We further discuss considerations and implications for the design of effective awe-inspiring VR applications.</p>

  <p>At cultural heritage sites, visitors are typically presented with official information, while the informal stories shared by local people often go unnoticed. To investigate how generative AI could help individuals access these local narratives, we organized a workshop with 20 participants. They were tasked with using Stable Diffusion to generate images of both familiar and unfamiliar cultural heritage sites, allowing for comparison. The findings identified three key narrative strategies and demonstrated the potential of generative AI to illuminate, amplify, and reinterprete personal narratives. However, the AI struggled with meeting specific requirements, accurately depicting cultural features, and avoiding bias. These issues were particularly evident when participants worked with unfamiliar sites, as they lacked local knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we suggest offering detailed explanations, utilizing prompt engineering, and fine-tuning AI models to reduce ambiguity. Additionally, objective references should be used to prevent inaccuracies, and curating datasets are needed to better train AI in depicting cultural features with precision. </p>

      <p>Awe has beem found to effectively enhance resilience by fostering a sense of meaning, evoking gratitude, and promoting social connectedness, which can help Chinese children manage the stress and anxiety stemming from a highly competitive learning environment. Following the positive outcomes of our VR awe-inspiring experience research with young adults, we aimed to explore whether the same VR design could effectively elicit awe in children and how they would perceive the virtual experience. We conducted an experiment with 42 children aged 11-12. Preliminary results indicate that the VR awe-inspiring scene successfully induced awe compared to the VR control scene. Additionally, we observed some common responses across all VR experiences. For instance, participants tended to seek out familiar virtual elements to establish an initial sense of safety. These findings could inform the design of future VR experiences aimed at inducing positive emotions specifically for children.</p>

      <p><strong>He, Z.</strong>, Xie, Z., Wang, Z., Gao, Z. </p>
      <p>I found that many VR awe-inspiring experience design strategies mentioned in current research are limited to specific scenes, such as the overview effect or lucid dreaming. However, repeatedly experiencing the same awe-inspiring scene diminishes the viewer's intensity of awe. Therefore, I decided to explore a broadly applicable design strategy that supports the creation of various awe-inspiring VR experiences, allowing viewers to maintain a high level of awe by switching between different VR scenes.
To achieve this, I systematically reviewed papers on awe induction from 2003 to 2023 from sources like ACM, IEEE, and APA PsycINFO, analyzing common elements across different forms of awe experiences, such as newspapers, pictures, and videos. Based on these elements, I developed an awe experience design strategy.
To verify the effectiveness of this strategy, we designed five different awe-inspiring VR scenes and one control scene, conducting experiments with university students. Our results show that the five awe-inspiring scenes significantly evoked higher levels of awe than the control scene, demonstrating that our design strategy can effectively be applied to different VR awe-inspiring scene designs.</p>
